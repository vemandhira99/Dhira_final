/**
 * DESIGN INTENT:
 * Section 09: Voices from the Field.
 *
 * Replaces the previous 3-up uniform `.card-attio` grid (which violated
 * AGENTS.md Rule 1 — "if you are about to reach for a generic card pattern
 * for a new section, stop") with editorial pull-quotes set in Newsreader
 * (the sanctioned "occasional editorial pull-quote" voice).
 *
 * Built off Linear's testimonial rail (display:flex with each quote sized
 * to its natural text length), lifted onto the white page field as a
 * vertical stack of asymmetric, card-free "field dispatches" — see the
 * dedicated <VoicesDispatches/> client child.
 *
 * Each dispatch's body type scales INVERSELY to its quote length (the
 * editorial front-page pull-quote rule: the line whose weight matters most
 * gets the most ink). Hovering a dispatch lifts it and dims its siblings,
 * with a thin blue left-edge accent streak re-using TheProof / FieldLedger's
 * scaleY(0→1) indicator language — visual cohesion between the two editorial
 * sections bracketing the dark ProvenAtScale inversion.
 *
 * Rule 2 (✓ discipline): no check glyphs — these are subjective field
 * testimonials, not verified external facts. No star ratings, no quote-bubble
 * SVGs (the drop-quote glyph is a typographic " character, not a bubble).
 * No auto-scroll marquee. No 3-card bento grid.
